Our comedian presenter wanted to be an astronaut, was given a reality check as a Dutch boy, so wanted to enlist in the Air Force, but asked too many questions, so wanted to become a pilot, but that's driving a bus in the sky, so wanted to design airplanes, so ended up in Industrial design faculty, therefore he is now a comedian. :D


Lodewijk vd Bergh, astronaut, was NL, now American.

It's easier to train a scientist to be an astronaut than to take an astronaut and make him a scientist.

NASA asked if he was interested, he said "yes." Happened to stay as an open option through several selection pages, 3 day physical at NASA and he was still in! And he was just randomly selected as the prime crewmember.

Space is a rather large risk. :D
So imagine that you've got very rational astronauts, you're seated on a massive explosive rocket, you turn it on and say "fire it up!" and, uh. GEEZ. How come such a rational decision of "GET OFF THIS ROCKET, IT'S A MASSIVE EXPLOSIVE" gets overridden emotionally by how we feel about SPACE?

Did experiments in microgravity.

Many aspects on our life. Conservation of angular momentum, you really notice that you spin faster when your arms come in!

Yu can make freefloating drops of grape juice, But surface tension eventually makes the dot come up the straw to hit him in the face when he drinks it!

As you want to repair things there is no direction "down" and so you do not go "under" the car, but you are just the same as you were when you were "above". You actually get THREE dimensions! That's AMAZING!

Crystal formation can be studied in microgravity without convective flows driven by gravity. 

Space changed everything! GPS, communication, images from space, velcro -- lots of interesting solutions from space race. So we must remember:

    The most scientific exploration is satellite-based, robots are more efficient than humans. 
    But those aren't experiments, those are explorers.
    Real experiments are prohibitive: can we move the Earth 5000 km further from the Sun? :D

What solutions make us optimistic about space program's future. 
    We've solved satellites, we don't need more research on that. What else?
    We'd like to work with the Chinese, get a big worldwide program running. Chinese modules are designed to couple with the International Space Station. 
    Official statement that we work together, worldwide.

What we really need: more effort, to benefit everyone in the world. Real globality.
    We need a planet-wide space program!

Story of advantages of going in space that you wouldn't expect.
    San Fran airport, nubile ladies with long robes, barefoot, pamphlets.
    They ask you to come to some sort of meeting.
    You have trouble dealing with them, until you've been to space.
    "Have you ever had an extraterrestrial experience?" "Of course I have! Haven't you?!"
        She thought "this guy is more crazy than I am!"
    Real bottom line: there's a real possibility that she's right.
