Lowie Vermeersch on "Beautiful Mobility"
I design some very pretty cars, Ferraris and Maseratis, but I have a love-hate relationship with them. At a distance I hate the problems of congestion and polution, they make the environment ugly. So the main goal of design is not being served by my cars.  

I vividly remember that moment that I entered a barn, dust flew in, fell on that car in the corner, love at first sight, quickly bought a new one. Honestly it wasn't even that beautiful, but it was interaction with a *character* for me. The car *did* something to me. It was a character.

I spent three years under that car, the outer shape represents that which sits within. And that made me choose transparency, to see all the elements together. True beauty can only come when the different aspects of a car come together in a coherent way.

The aesthetic experience attracts you. That's important. But once you get into the interactio of the car, you should experience that beauty without disappointment, an ongoing feeling. So aesthetics is a *promise* of the actual, real beauty felt in use. 

Beauty is honesty and passion and care. care in the object's surface, those lines, is very important. the main lesson for me is, when you work on a car like this, what you do is always working on a tiny bit of a much larger whole. Cars are evolving as if they were a species. Lots were tried; few survived, our new designs were based on that. So there seems to be a convergence to a natural state of an ideal car. But there are competing forces at play, like cost etc.

So you are not alone. Social forces compel you to make your choices. But you have a deep inner desire to create new art, to create a new balance between the compelled form and the individuality.

One thing that I like about the evolution is the beauty. But one thing that I don't like is that there are rules and regulations. There are people in our company who have to make sure that what we do is actually legal! Less harm is a very good objective, but you might have to accept four fixed points on the front of the car, to protect drivers in cars. Those points require that you raise the hood. This can require people to sit higher, so we have to make the car wider, that requires bigger breaks, that requires bigger wheels, which requires a bigger engine, which requires a higher hood.

So when you come out from university you have these big dreams, but then within a given segment, you only really have a couple centimeters to play with design, surface, reflections. Otherwise it's a nice idea but it won't end up on the road.

So what dooes this mean? Are we fashion designers draping new clothes on a pretty fixed body? for now, yes, but I don't think that's the end of the story.

What happens when a lot of cars begin to communicate with each other? We can maybe use networking to remove the requirements about cars crashing! This lifts those fixed points. It's just no longer a problem!

So if we could make the cars a little lighter, we could save billions of dollars invested in steel, a (5km)^3 of steel. The cars could have better interaction with people and they can go even more into transparency, different behaviour when stuck in a car, and increase safety. So I think we'll see an explosion of different ideas in mobility, not just vehicles but how we design.

And this lets us create a beautiful experience.

So we're coming upon a fixed point in the current context of the industrial revolution. But I think new possibilities will come with the digital revolution. New nonphysical elements like communication will be very important. 

And we focus on creating pleasure, because all of the rest of these ideas only survive if they give us pleasure. So it has to make our lives better in quality. We need a different approach therefore in what a car designer is. It's no longer just making the cars pretty -- though that's certainly important. But to really make it important we need to involve design in a much larger spectrum of elements.

Designers put together all of these quality of life goals together in a big coherent way. And then I will be there to focus on these very last lines. Because my objects contain my passion, ready to be released at a touch.
