Theo Jansen on "a new breed of beach animals."

40 years ago I was studying physics like Leo Kouwenhoven, but I wasn't so good a student, so I became an artist instead. I try to make new forms of life, not based on proteins.

>    Proteins renew themselves all of the time. But we don't have millions of years to let our proteins develop.

Numbers reproduce themselves in computers.

Electricity tubes that you can use to build new artificial beasts with efficient evolutionary algorithms to make wireframe critters walk across the beach. You use some computer modeling, some practical engineering.

The goal is to have wind drive "feathers" which power the internal mechanical structure, this allows them to walk. Also they detect water or rocks and turn around. Many "species" of crawler designs. Some look positively ginormous. :D

Creatures often "lived" for just a second before their knees gave out. They also get caught in sand. Little peripheral animals can sometimes detect that the main animal is going into a bad region, and the main animal can "pull them out."

Leg system came 20 years ago or so. A spine makes a certain motion, so that your foot stays level, picks up on the other side to "return." Genetic algorithm determined which lengths of tubes are important, it gave back 13 numbers which described the ideal motion.

The hollow tubes funnel a purely pneumatic system. The "feathers" or "wings" pump air into a bottle, which acts as a capacitor to give energy storage in cola bottles. Little pneumatic "switches" act as neurons that can contain zeroes and ones. Beach animals can then detect where they are.

How do we make these beasts reproduce? ;-D

But these strange beasts are multiplying "behind my back." Erik earlier said, "We need gadgets but the gadgets need us to multiply." Well now other humans are making similar strangebeasts! You can find all sorts of Youtube videos! So the idea *infected* this artist, and is now *infecting* other humans in this world! The idea snatches our bodies. They make us make them.

"This is a Japanese strangebeast. *PUFF* *PUFF* *PUFF*... ...well if you put it in the wind it works quite well."

Composition of four animals stuck together, because individually they would blow away in the wind. Also they drown very easily. Tubes notice that watter flows in. 

His devices have twenty legs and basically run everywhere. :DDDD
