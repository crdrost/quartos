What would the dream school look like?
I am a college dropout. Tim is a dropout whose in school already. ^_^
I think of things not yet imagined, make unique links, and 

Designers have these ideas even if you don't ask them to.

Why schools? a friend was building a school. I have two kids and he also had two kids. So it's a very selfish reason for both of us.

But the school will be realized. I can think about them in theory, but this will be actual. 12-18 year old. 3000 students, 300 staff (?), to teach people to be technical workers.

Dream gap:: born - 22 years old. AT born, you have all the potential in the world, but by the time you're 22 your potential falls to 0. That's an education "waterfall." the more you choose, the mory you lose.

So how do we close this dream gap, let you be what you want to be. We don't hate schools; how do we complement them to do it even better.

Yo uhave an idea, let's see if it works.

Value-Added Tax: we like adding value, we don't like tax. :D But let's have Value Added to Schools. You take 6% of the stuff going to the school and throw a big party (?)

NDA, do not disclose anything. That's annoying! People like me are screwed by this discussion of what you cannot do. On the other hand, DA "do disclose" model: one page of the things you *are* allowed to say.

Internshops. Offices and churches and shops become vacant. There's a lot of space there, not being used! So why not bring kids into these dead shops and see whether playful learning can happen there.

Pay It Forward - can it be a business model? Start-up, you need 100% and you have no money. Collaborate with students? When you are built-up you need 110%  and your money is high, you build a networkd and so on.

Flexwork. You need specialists here. with the same budget but more time, maybe we can have students help out on professional projects, and so have fun?

Get rid of businesscards. You're more than your LinkedIn. Prefer to say who you are, not what you are.

Start random conversations on trains, and in schools, and on planes. If you get a businesscard, hand it along to someone new and hope they call each other and have a random conversation.

CSR -evolution. (What the hell is CRS?) 7 billion people is a crowd. Change, learn, because unlearning is not doable.

Shell said they had to change from Human resources to human development. You can't just replace humans, you have to grow them. :D

I'd redesign TED to TED. TED isn't Tech Ent, Design, it's T-shaped, Educational, Deep thought (?)
